				[A] COVENANT- 「Mana」 - If the deployed Tranceunion is 「Mana」, if you have 3 or more cards in your Level Zone, look at the top 3 cards of your deck, choose one of them, put it face-up into your Level Zone, put the rest back on top of your deck in any order, choose a face-up card in your Level Zone, and Drop it.</p>

			<p>So, if people haven't realized, I really like Mana. New Mana support is really exciting for me as a result. Anways, so with this card, Mana gets a much-needed universal Covenant, similar to the variousc cards in Aid &amp; Arms. The first card allows you to draw a card, which is great, because who doesn't love free cards? Combined with <a href="http://www.heartofthecards.com/code/cardlist.html?card=LL_EB01/037">Sky and Sea and Mana</a> or <a href="http://www.heartofthecards.com/code/cardlist.html?card=LL_BT03/079">Don't Give Up! Mana</a>, Mana decks draw even more cards than ever. While I don't think it replaces either of the two prior Mana covenants, its certainly a strong additional option, and gives a strong Covenant before Level 4.</p>
			
			<p>Secondly, we have a Artemis Covenant. This card allows us to not only replace a card out of our Level Zone (more easilly getting Manas in Level for the Mana Covenant and Trance Rare), but also lets us control the top 2 cards of the deck. And since Covenant abilities are resolved in any order, we can use to to control the card we draw with today's Mana. Good effects all around.</p>
			
			<p>Basically, I really like Mana. She's really cute. And got me to second place at Nationals, so she's great. More support is amazing. I like drawing cards.</p>
