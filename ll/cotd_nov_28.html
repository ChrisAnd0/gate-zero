				<p>Meeting Expectations, Nina<br />
				World: Tritomy<br />
				[A] COVENANT - &lt;Nina&gt; If the deployed Tranceunion is "Nina", if you have 3 or more cards in Level Zone, look at the top 4 cards of your deck, choose a Paradox among them, put it to your Paradox Zone, and put the rest back on top of your deck in any order.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="clearleft">This card, like <a href="http://www.heartofthecards.com/code/cardlist.html?card=LL_BT01/099">Break the Sonic Barrier, Sieghard</a>, allows for a Paradox to be played outside of Logic Definition. Unlike the Sieghard, however, this Nina effect is significantly less costly to perform, from a card and a stock to the low cost of "free." It also doesn't use up your Logic Drive for the turn, which makes it even more appealing. The downside is the unfortunate potential for the effect to fail to find a Paradox, but in that case, you still get to arrange the top 4 cards of your deck, which still certainly isn't bad, particularly as a Tritomy card. (Even if Nina doesn't take advantage of that as much as some other characters.)</p>
			
			<p>What I find interesting is how this card also seems to represent the change in both Sieghard and Nina's playstyles. In their original sets, Sieghard had a lot of cards that manipulated Paradoxes and Nina focused more on limiting your opponent's options. In Aid and Arms, however, Sieghard shifted more towards Tactics and Nina more towards Aura. This card, being a Tritomy Nina card, further solidifies this change in playstyle.</p>
