				[LD] [(3)] For the turn, this member gets Power +3000 and the ability "[A] [Drop 2 of this Member's Soul] At the start of this member's the End of Battle step, you may pay the cost. If you do, Stand this member, and for the turn, this member gets Power +7000, and if there are 3 or more cards in your opponent's Battle Zone, this gets +Aura.</p>

			<p>I think that one of the most frustrating things about Trance Re:union is the fact that the Trance Rares are finishers for Tamaki, Chloe, Yukari, and Mana, who are likely the 4 characters who need them the least. These four characters specifically already have strong finishing potential, and their Trance Rares are extra options, not really new effects. Regardless, we've got a good card for Yukari today, even if its not particularly stand-out as Yukari already has other options.</p>
			
			<p>Today's Yukari has a Logic Drive that puts her at 15k, which is pretty standard for cards like this. After that, you can drop its soul (which is -2k) for a restand and +7k, putting you at 20k, which is still a significant number (multiple of 5k) and quite good. You also may gain an Aura, which basically wins you the member's next fight if you get it. If you don't, you likely won the first fight, though, as having less than 2 cards in the battle zone isn't really a fight.</p>
			
			<p>Basically, like all Trance Rares, Yukari aims to win you a fight. It doesn't really do much else, and is somewhat boring as a result. It does its job well, and is very easy to pull off, but doesn't really boost Yukari decks to new heights or anything of the sort. It's simply a solid finisher option.</p>
