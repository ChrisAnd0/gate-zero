			<p>Persona 5 continues with a bunch more interesting cards (also best girl, Futaba is so cute). We've got a bunch of cards fitting of a navigator. A 3/2 support, while increasingly more common, is still notable in the game due to the unique types of abilities that tend to be printed on these cards, and Futaba doesn't disappoint. A global 1.5k is a nice first effect, and a post-damage check is a good recent ability. The last ability on the 3/2 Futaba is a Climax discard for an anti-damage. While similar to <a href="http://www.heartofthecards.com/code/cardlist.html?card=WS_CHA/W40-077">"Something Precious" Nao Tomori</a> from Charlotte, Futaba has the advantage of working in any slot, so it isn't quite as easily countered by untargetable characters.</p>
			
			<p>The other notable Futaba allows us to search our Stock. This allows us to get cards out of Stock without destroying all of our Stock. It's not a large assortment of cards to look through (explaining the low cost) but its still a card for a Stock, which is really good. Note that the effect can't be used with only 1 Stock, as the cost is paid before the effect. Also notably is that the card can search for Events, so it can also be slotted into other Persona decks outside of Persona 5 (such as <a href="http://www.heartofthecards.com/code/cardlist.html?card=WS_P3/S01-095">Execution</a>.)</p>
			
			<p>The last card is a Morgana, which is a standard beater that gets bigger as your other characters attack. Not much to say here, these cards are generally good tech options, provided the space.</p>
