			<h2>WIXOSS - Player Abilities in the Lostorage Anime</h2>
			
			<p>WIXOSS is undoubtably the best card game anime out there. The plot is solid, the characters are interesting, and who does want moe girls and despair? Anyways, with the new season, there's a bunch of new characters, and a new Coin mechanic, which basically acts as another resource to gather and pay costs from. It's rather easy to get, as many new LRIGs give Coins when you Grow. Easy enough. So... What do some of these cards do?</p>

				<p>Meru=Martini<br />
				[A] When your Accessorized SIGNI is banaished by an effect other than your own, you may draw a card.<br />
				[A] At the start of your Main Phase, you may reveal the top 3 cards of your deck. Choose an Accessory card among them, put it to Ener Zone, and put the rest on bottom of your deck in any order.<br />
				[S] BESERK - [3 Coins] During their next turn, your opponent cannot use ARTS, spells, or [S] abilities, and their SIGNI must attack if able.</p>

				<p>Painful Separation From Loved Ones<br />
				This ARTS can only be used during the opponent's turn.<br />
				BET - [1 Coin]<br />
				For the turn, whenever 1 of your SIGNI is banished not by your own effect, banish 1 of your opponent's SIGNI.<br />
				If you BET, whenever 1 of your SIGNI is banished not by your own effect, put the top card of your Deck to Life Cloth.</p>

			<p>That's.... broken. Uh... maybe WIXOSS wasn't such a good idea.</p>
			
			<p>Quick disclaimer: This article was meant as a joke, I still intend to play WIXOSS, even if not as a focus. Still, new cards are really good.</p>
