			</div>
			
			<p>So this is certainly one of the most complex effects in all of Wei&beta; Schwarz, and it breaks a few rules and introduces some new card types to get there.</p>
			
			<p>Rule broken #1: 1/0s don't have Soul Triggers.<br />
			So 1/0s don't usually have Soul Triggers. And honestly, this kinda makes these cards a bit nuts. We can now play a deck with around 34 Soul Triggers that isn't expensive (and full of underpowered 1/1s) since, well, our costless 1/0s have Soul Triggers, meaning we can have good damage output even when we don't play a Climax. This isn't even counting the fact that the Cocoa and Rize give soul if you mill Soul Triggers. Easy, easy soul.</p>
			
			<p>Rule broken #2: A climax that doesn't do anyhting in the Climax Zone.<br />
			So if your Climax doesn't do anything in the zone its intended for, it better do something good. I'd call giving everything 4k pretty good. 1/0 9k L1s is really good. 1/0 13ks is even better, except then you have a 6 Climax deck, so this bit might be too risky.</p>
			
			<p>So, what do we get for literally building our deck around this combo? I think the most notable and overlooked thing is that the Level 1s all have Soul Triggers, meaning we can build a deck with 34-Soul Triggers without stock issues. Once upon a time, I played a deck of 42 vanillas, because it had 1/1 6k vanillas with Soul Triggers. This deck is remarkably good for what it does. Having a deck this trigger-heavy is crazy. Doing it for free? Where has this been all game?</p>
			
			<p>Not to mention that it also still gets power and (some) cards, and extra soul. This deck is going to be crazy, just wait.</p>
