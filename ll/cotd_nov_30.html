				[A] COVENANT - &lt;Ashley&gt; or 「Jade」 If the deployed Tranceunion is 「Ashley」, if you have 3 or more cards in your Level Zone, look through your Stock and Drop as many of them as you like. Put the top X+1 cards of your deck into Stock, and shuffle your Stock. X is the number of Stock Dropped with this effect.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p>Solid card. On one hand, its a standard covenant to gain a Stock, which Green has plenty of. But, on the other, you can use it to specifically target cards you want out of your Stock when you refresh, such as Paradoxes, or to trigger effects of Ashleys that have effects when Dropped from Stock, such as <a href="http://www.heartofthecards.com/code/cardlist.html?card=LL_BT03/068">Elegantly Cute Sleeves, Ashley</a>. It's a strong card overall, but functionally similar to many other Green covenants.</p>
