				<p>Barrier of Affection, Tamaki<br />
				World: Tetraheaven<br />
				[A] When this member is defending, when you perform Level Boost and Rest a card, if that card is a 「Tamaki」, for the battle, this member gets +Aura.<br />
				[LD] [(3)] If you have 2 Tamaki in your Level Zone, choose one of your opponent's members, and during your opponent's next turn, it gets the ability "[C] This member cannot Stand."</p>

				<p>Excitement, Venus<br />
				World: Tetraheaven<br />
				[A] COVENANT - 「Tamaki」 If the deployed Tranceunion is 「Tamaki」, choose a 「Tamaki」 in your Level Zone and put it to the bottom of your deck. If a card was returned with this ability, put the top card of your deck in Level Zone.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p>These cards are somewhat interesting. The first effect, unlike nearly every other effect like it, requires an exact number of cards in Level Zone, rather than X or more. The effect is strong, of course, basically forcing the opponent to either overplay or waste an attack. Its very difficult to pull off, and while the first effect is also quite good, on defense, only every other Level Boost would then give an effective bonus, and it also requires the player to Level Boost on defense, which either means the player didn't Level Boost on attack (which is a bad idea anyways) or didn't Define Logic on attack (which is unreliable, as it depends on how the opponent is playing).</p>
			
			<p>The Venus helps somewhat, as it makes it somewhat easier to get the exactly 2 Tamaki in Level Zone, but its still unreliable. Overall, these cards have potential to be strong, but ultimately end up being too unreliable compared to the support Tamaki already has.</p>
