			<h2>About</h2>
			
			<p>This is Gate Zero, my personal webpage where I write my various ramblings about my card game adventures.</p>

			<p>The project was started after several years of playing card games, wherein my friends frequently brought up the idea for a blog to share ideas and musings I’ve had throughout. Apparently, I’ve had good ideas and my friends have been impressed, so I suppose I’ll start sharing them.</p>

			<p>So, more specifically, this site will primarily focus on Luck &amp; Logic, with Wei&beta; Schwarz also being featured. Other card games (Chaos, Vanguard, WIXOSS, Fire Emblem Cipher, School Idol Collection) may appear, but infrequently and will all be grouped under “Other.”</p>

			<p>My primary focus is on general card and play mechanics, followed by deck techs, followed by specific card analysis. As a result, at least at first, there will be a higher volume of general strategy articles rather than specific deck analysis. Don’t worry, we’ll get to more specific analysis as time goes on.</p>

			<p>Also of note is that I play Japanese-edition card games, so my analysis will be specific to the Japanese meta of these games. This doesn’t mean that the information is irrelevant to the English edition, but that there may be aspects that don’t fully translate if you’re playing the English game. (This applies more to Wei&beta; Schwarz than Luck &amp; Logic, since the there are more differences in the meta between languages for that game.)</p>
			
			<p>Any translations found on this site are done by me using my limited knowledge of Japanese, unless otherwise noted. If there is a mistake, I'll try to get it fixed as soon as possible. I'm passable at Japanese, not proficient, and apologize for any errors.</p>

			<p>One final note should go without saying, but the writings here are the opinions of myself and my friends that play card games with me. I try to keep myself well-informed on the games I play and consider myself a high-level player, but I do make mistakes. Not all articles may be absolutely correct in every situation, but I aim to make my writings as concise and complete as possible. Regardless, disagreement is certainly allowed, so long as civility is maintained.</p>

			<p>So, without further ado, let’s begin! Welcome to Gate Zero!</p>
