			<p>My name is Chris, and this is my personal space for writing various card game ramblings. I tend to write a lot and ramble a bit, but I’d like to imagine that there’s some good information in those ramblings, so here we are.</p>
			
			<p>I’ve been playing lots of different card games for many years, and have seemed to settle down on the Japanese card games of Luck &amp; Logic and Wei&beta; Schwarz. As a result, the majority of the content on this site will focus on those two games. I still play other games from time to time, so you might also find content on whatever other game(s) too.</p>

			<p>So, who exactly am I? I already said my name is Chris, but why should you care about my writings?</p> 
			
			<p>Honestly, I’m not sure either, but my friends seem to think I’m a Good Card Gamer and that I should write my stuff down, so here it is. (Remember kids, it’s not science until you write it down.)</p>

			<p>So some more things about me. I’m currently a student at the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, New York. Yes, it’s cold. No, it doesn’t bother me too much. I’ve lived in the Northeastern United States pretty much my entire life, so you get used to it. I play cards at Hammergirl Anime, which is conveniently just down the road from campus. You can find me there most weekends with the rest of my friends. (Yes, Hammergirl is where the Nationals are held for Weiss Schwarz and Luck and Logic. How convenient for me. Might be why I got into those games.)</p>

			<p>So, what have I done? What makes my words any more or less valid than anyone else’s? I can’t answer that specifically, but I can list some of my accomplishments.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.heartofthecards.com/ws/wgp2014/wgp2014-regional-reports.html">2014 Hammergirl Anime Wei&beta; Schwarz Regional, Champion</a></li>
				<li>2014 Wei&beta; Schwarz Nationals competitor</li>
				<li><a href="http://www.heartofthecards.com/ws/wgp2015/results/nationals.html">2015 Wei&beta; Schwarz Nationals, Top 16</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://www.heartofthecards.com/ll/nats2016/nats2016-results.html">2016 Hammergirl Anime Luck &amp; Logic Regional, Champion</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://www.heartofthecards.com/ll/nats2016/nats2016-results.html">2016 Prime Logicalist Luck and &amp; National Tournament, Runner-up</a></li>
				<li>2016 Wei&beta; Schwarz Nationals competitor</li>
			</ul>

			<p>So that’s something. The Luck &amp; Logic placings are probably the more impressive and the ones I personally am more proud of. Regardless, I can’t make you listen to what I have to say, but that’s who I am, more or less.</p>
