			In all seriousness, though, we begin Persona 5 card spoilers with some interesting cards. First off, we have a spammable brainstorm in the Persona 5 Trial Deck. Our good 'ol mascot Morgana offers a pretty standard Assist 500 and a pretty standard spammable salvage brainstorm. Two really solid abilities on a single card, but not much else to speak of here.</p>
			
			<p>Our other card today is a Protagonist climax combo, along with confirmation that the newest Persona set still uses the same name for its Protagonist. Unfortunately, our first card here relies on the Phantom Thief trait, so this card doesn't actually slot very well into Protagonist decks. The option is open for future cards, though, so it'll be interesting to see if we get any notable new support. Now, in regards to the actual card in question, we've got a reasonable early-play condition and a really strong climax combo that both draws and searches. 2 cards is great, but realistically, particularly with the power and need to reverse to activate, its an effect we'd most want at Level 1, but its early-play condition ensures we only get one of him out realistically. Getting more requres overplaying characters (which diminishes the power of cards gained) or for us to be at Level 2, at which point 7k power isn't always enough to reverse characters to activate the ability. Still, the effect seems to still be worth playing, as a very easy to pull off 2 card gain.</p>
