			<p>GochiUsa EB spoilers begin with a brand-new finisher Climax Combo for &lt;&lt;Rabbit House&gt;&gt; decks. Burning for 1 twice is really powerful, similar to double spark (such as <a href="http://www.heartofthecards.com/code/cardlist.html?card=WS_PY/S38-003">"Bayoe~n" Arle</a> but with the obvious advantage of the opponent not needing to cancel to deal the extra damage. Of course, the disadvantage is how expensive the effect is. Pay 2 pitch 2 isn't a light cost in the slightest, so when playing this card, your goal is to win this turn. The draw 2 pitch 1 on play helps, but the player still has to enter the turn with 5 cards in hand (6 if they don't tick) and 10 stock to do the burn effect 3 times. Additionally, there are no costless Level 1 combos for &lt;&lt;Rabbit House&gt;&gt; to sustain that many cards in hand the entire game. Doing the effect once or twice is good, but the best burn finishers are the ones that can be done multiple times, and this card struggles with that without additional support.</p>
