				[LD] [(X)] For the turn, this member gets Power +1000 * X. Additionally, if X is 4 or more, this gets +[Aura]. Additionally, if X is 7 or more, draw 2 cards. Additionally, if X is 10 or more, this gets Limit +2.</p>

			<p class="clearleft">Today's card is pretty interesting. Me and my friends have been discussing it for a while, and being a Trance Rare, it's certainly a strong finisher, as it should be. The more stock you have, obviously the stronger the card gets, but I think its also interesting to note the power thresholds before 10 stock.</p>
			
			<p>At 4 stock, you get an extra Aura. At this point, Chloe becomes a 16k attacker (enough to beat most Level 4s) with 2 Aura. This will force at least 2 cards from your opponent just to get over the Chloe, so 4 stock is honestly an amazing card effect by itself. But it continues</p>
			
			<p>At 7 stock, you draw 2 cards. This is on par with <a href="http://www.heartofthecards.com/code/cardlist.html?card=LL_BT01/100">Continuing Battle, Aoi</a> for stock-to-cards ratio. Really good. This much stock puts Chloe at a 19k attacker with 2 Aura, which doesn't really make a difference in power over being a 16k attacker in many situations. You're hitting this threshold for the cards. More interesting, however, is if you spend 1 more stock to have a 20k attacker. This does put you at a notable threshold, forcing a third Power card from your opponent, encouraging a Paradox play instead of power.</p>
			
			<p>Finally, if you use 10 or more stock, Chloe also gains +2 Limit. By this point, you've gained so much resource from the previous thresholds that this particular threshold seems to be more of a "because I can" type of deal. The real strength of the card comes from having Power, Aura, and cards. Limit seems to be a bonus rather than a key feature of the card.</p>
