				[A] When your character's Direct Attack's damage is not cancelled, choose a face-down card in your opponent's Memory and put it to the Waiting Room. If you do, search your deck for a &lt;&lt;Phantom Thief&gt;&gt; or &lt;&lt;Sports&gt;&gt; character, show it to your opponent, put it into your hand, and shuffle your deck.</p>

				If your opponent's Memory has no face-down cards, your opponent chooses a card in their hand and puts it in Memory face-down, and draws a card.<br />
				Look at up to the top 4 cards of your deck, choose a &lt;&lt;Phantom Thief&gt;&gt; character among them, add it to your hand, and put the rest of the cards to the Waiting Room.<br />
				Choose one of your opponents Front Row Cost 0 or lower characters, and you may return it to their hand.</p>

			<p>We've got several good cards here. The event is quite interesting, being a good 1/0 check 4 event with a few extra abilities. It's good for the check 4, but activating the 0/0's effect is an added bonus (even if it ultimately does allow your opponent to filter a card). It's still not an ideal filter for the opponent, as the card stays in Memory for a bit, so they probably won't use it to filter Climaxes and such, so it doesn't really matter too much that they get a filter.</p>
			
			<p>The global 500 is good for being a global 500, but can also get a card under certain circumstances. Really good, but not much else to say. The search is convoluted, but global power is good, so we play it for the global effect anyways.</p>
			
			<p>Lastly, we have a way to salvage our event. Important, considering how much it does. Not much else to say here either, its just a good filter and consistency booster.</p>
